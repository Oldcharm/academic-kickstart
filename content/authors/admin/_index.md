- Iâ€™m a second-year undergraduate in the School of Material Science at Beijing University of Chemical Technology.
- I study Polymer Science and Engineering with a minor major in Biology. 
- I am doing remote research on the cell envelope of Gram negative bacteria advised by Professor Markus Basan, mentored by Severin Schink. 
- Prior to that, I joined Professor Jiajia Xue's lab last summer. I have an ongoing project on antibacterial wound dressing based on electrospun materials.
- My research interests generally lie in the area of systems biology and bioinformatics. I am enthusiastic about exploring biological topics with both theoretical and experimental approaches.
